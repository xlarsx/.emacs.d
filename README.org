#+TITILE: README

Personal GNU/Emacs configuration with the philosophy:

- Cross-platform as much as possible.
- Using standard key bindings if available.
- Standard packages or non-intrusive packages preferible.
- Using default configuration enabled, with minor exceptions.
- For non repetitive tasks, using =M-x command= is acceptable.

Using as inspiration content/work from:

- [[https://protesilaos.com][Protesilaos Stavrou]]
- [[https://cestlaz.github.io][Mike Zamansky]]
- [[https://distro.tube][Derek Taylor]]
- [[https://systemcrafters.net][David Wilson]]
- [[https://henrik.io][Henrik Lissner]]

Notes:

- Tested using GNU/Emacs 29
- Frequent [[https://github.com/xlarsx/.emacs.d/wiki/GNU-Emacs-Common-Key-Bindings][GNU/Emacs Key Bindings]] (live document with the keybindings that I use the most, useful to use with this configuration that promote default configurations)
